# About community chats

A public, easily reachable, chat space where people can find others implementing the DPG. Different channels can be made for different types of profiles: i.e. a developers channel and an admin channel. On more advanced communities, people may have channels specialized in regions (i.e. Africa users) or interested in specific activities (i.e. policy building, or translation)"

## How to implement 

The first and most important aspect is tool selection. [AlternativeTo's updated compilation of Group Chats](https://alternativeto.net/category/social/group-chat/) page is a good place to start. While we are choosing not to recommend any single one option, we have compiled a guide to help you choose the right one for your community:

  - Whether you self-host or use a service hosted by someone else. Open Source alternatives like Matrix.org and Rocket.Chat are good options for self-hosting. Matrix enables you to federate with other servers. Have in mind self-hosting requires allocating time for mantaining the service as well as a capable server. Options such as Telegram or Whatsapp are hosted freely, but keep in mind you won't own the data on it.  
  - Choose an app that enables you to create different channels. This way you can have different spaces for different topics or profiles. This feature may be called different in different apps, such as "rooms" in Matrix or "channels" in Slack, "topics" in Telegram, etc.
  - Make sure there's a system for people to easily be invited to the chat. Each application has its own sign-up workflow. For example, Telegram, Whatsapp and Slack have shareable links to join. Matrix has public chat links.

Once you have chosen the proper tool, create an easily remberable link to the chat space. We recommend pointing directly from your website, something like chat.thenameofyourdomain.org or thenameofyourdomain.org/chat so that you can easily distribute it on presentations, and in-person gatherings. To do this, simply ask your IT administrator to point any of this links created by your to the corresponding link on your chosen app. You can see how this works by checking out how its done at Decidim on chat.decidim.org.

# About the code repository

Code for a DGP must be public and on a version control repository. A version control repository is a tool that takes the form of a website that's specialized in hosting code and provides collaboration tools for contributors users and code mantainers of the project to interact, examine the code, collaborate and contribute. Developers are well versed in the usage of this kind of tooling and should be able to set one up for your project.

Here are some features of a Version control code repository: 


1. Version Control: Tracking Changes & Preventing Loss

Version control keeps a complete history of changes, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed. This prevents data loss and simplifies debugging. Branching enables developers to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase until they are ready to merge.

2. Collaboration: Enabling Contributions from Multiple Developers

Multiple contributors can work simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes. Branching and merging allow independent development and smooth integration, preventing conflicts and improving efficiency in distributed teams.

3. Transparency & Accountability

Every change is logged with details on who made it and why, ensuring a clear project history. This transparency enhances accountability and makes it easier to track progress, review past decisions, and manage contributions.

4. Code Review & Quality Control

Before merging, code is reviewed to ensure quality, identify bugs, and maintain standards. This process helps keep the project secure, efficient, and aligned with best practices while fostering learning among contributors.

5. Issue Tracking & Documentation

Repositories integrate issue tracking for reporting bugs, suggesting features, and planning updates. Built-in documentation ensures contributors understand the project, making collaboration smoother and more accessible.

Platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) provide these features, making version control essential for open-source development, ensuring structured collaboration, and maintaining project quality over time.

Options such as [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) and [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) can be self-hosted, and some teams or organizations choose to have their version control code repository instances, however as any self-hosted solution, this requires dedicated team time and server resources to mantain your service.

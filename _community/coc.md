description: A code of conduct is a document that establishes expectations for behavior for your project’s participants. Adopting, and enforcing, a code of conduct can help create a positive social atmosphere for your community.¹
title: Code of Conduct
---

There are two parts to implementing a Code of Conduct (CoC) that you should consider:
1. **Implementing one**: The text itself that will signal all of your contributors and participants to the project the range of Expected and Acceptable behaviours when contributing. The scope of the CoC (for example, the community spaces which it includes). And how will it be enforced, should any infringements happen: how can it be reported, what actions are expected to be taken, etc.
2. **Enforcing one**: In the event that a person infringes the CoC, to have a procedure to enforce it that enables any decisions to be taken transparently, and the involved parties to understand the course of actions taken, and to document the steps to each case, so that the rest of the community has a means of transparency and accountability for actions taken. 

A CoC can be established by including a file named `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` within the project repository, preferably at the root for easy finding.

description: A README file is a text file which introduces and explains the project¹. It is the first file any person looking at the code-base will see.

A README file is named as such, because it is intended to be the first file a person looks at when they see or download a piece of code. 

When using a platform to publish your code on the internet, such as Github or Gitlab, if there's a file named "README" on the Root directory of your code-base, the platform will display that file on the front-page of the code, so that it will be the first thing anyone visiting your code-base will see. 

You can build a README file by creating a file with a simple text editor (such as notepad, or gedit), name it README and choose an extension such as `.txt`. However, a good recommendation is to name it with the `.md` extension (to make it a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file). Markdown is recommended, because it is easy to use, and because most code-sharing platforms support an array of tools to enrich how your README looks like.

### For begginers
While there is no standard to what information should a README contain, Danny Guo's guide [**Make a readme**](https://www.makeareadme.com/#suggestions-for-a-good-readme) contains a very good start, as well as FAQ's about building good readmes, and a tool to build good starter READMEs. 

### For intermediate users
A good way to improve on a README is to look at other very good projects. Matias Singers has created a contributive and regularly up-to-date list of [Awesome Readmes](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) anyone can get inspiration from.

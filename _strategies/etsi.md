# About ETSI

ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) provides members with an open, inclusive and collaborative environment. This environment supports the timely development, ratification and testing of globally applicable standards for ICT-enabled systems, applications and services.

We are at the forefront of emerging technologies across all sectors of industry and society that make use of ICT. Our 900+ member organizations are drawn from over 60 countries and five continents.

As well as enhancing reputation, the many benefits of membership include:
- access to the most up-to-date information on global ICT standards
- direct participation in standards development
- competitive advantage through early standard adoption
- opportunities to network with industry leaders

We operate on a not-for-profit basis and are one of only three bodies officially recognized by the EU as a European Standards Organization.

# A European Standards Organization

ETSI is a European Standards Organization (ESO). We are the recognized regional standards body dealing with telecommunications, broadcasting and other electronic communications networks and services.

We have a special role in Europe. This includes supporting European regulations and legislation through the creation of Harmonised European Standards. Only standards developed by the three ESOs (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI) are recognized as European Standards (ENs).

# Our global impact

We were initially founded to serve European needs, but we have a global perspective. Our standards are now used the world over. 

We collaborate and work in partnership with different types of organizations around the world. This makes us well placed to support our members who operate in an increasingly international and competitive environment.

In addition, we are a partner in the international Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPPTM). Through this project, we are helping to develop 4G and 5G mobile communications. We also work with partners around the globe in the oneM2M partnership project to develop standards for machine-to-machine communications.
